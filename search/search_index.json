This led to the commoditization of drone-based mobility, which has redefined the way we use drones in a number of ways:</p> <ul> <li>DroneTech, a major player in the UAV market, has created a highly advanced   drone mobility solution; enabling you to purchase off-the-shelf drones,   and send them to perform deliveries using a REST API.</li> <li>Capitalizing on this, Amazon Prime Air, a drone delivery service for retail items,   has seen mainstream use.  Most consumers have designated drone delivery points   at their home, making delivery failures unlikely.</li> <li>The widespread adoption of drone technologies has led to modification of FAA   regulations on drone usage, allowing platforms like DroneTech's to opaquely   negotiate airspace access with FAA servers.</li> </ul> <p>This is exciting; these developments alleviate most of the fundamental barriers to home delivery of a cheap good via drone.</p>"},{"location":"dronuts/#your-idea","title":"Your Idea","text":"<p>You have a brainflash: software built atop the DroneTech API, coupled with a small fleet of the new drones, could help you capitalize on the vast untapped afternoon donut market!

They're not very tech-savvy, and they have their hands full with the existing business, so they'd rather serve as your first partner/supplier than as co-founders.  However, they have a couple of other friends at CMU, to whom they introduce you.  With those classmates, you officially found Dronuts, a startup company which delivers fresh donuts via drone.  You pool your resources and buy an initial fleet of 6 drones.</p>"},{"location":"dronuts/#your-product","title":"Your Product","text":"<p>Your basic idea is to build a cloud-backed web application,<sup>6</sup> with which several types of users will interact, approximately as follows:</p> <ul> <li>A donut-buying customer will use the app to select donuts from a menu   of items offered by the donut shop.</li> <li>The app will redirect customers to an external payment service, CommerceFriend,   to enter payment details for their items.</li> <li>The app will identify a suitable drone to perform the delivery based   on availability and battery life.  Various factors may influence battery life,   including distance, weight of the package, and weather/wind. Fortunately,   DroneTech's API includes a sophisticated algorithm for managing battery capacity,   allowing the drone to automatically return to the shop if the battery level is critical.</li> <li>The app will relay the order to the donut shop in Lawrenceville,   and will instruct employees which drone items are to be loaded into.   Once loaded, the app should send the drone out for delivery.</li> <li>The customer will be able to track the progress of their delivery in real-time   using the app, so they know when to retrieve the items from the drone.</li> </ul> <p>(For the purposes of the course, you don't need to worry about the actual physical drone hardware beyond the software considerations surrounding battery life.)</p> <p>This initial outline is deliberately open-ended, as we intend for you to apply and practice the skills you learn in this class in a realistic startup context.</p> <p>Over the course of the first half of the semester (eight weeks), you will work with your classmates to design, implement and analyze the software for this (hyopthetical) new startup.</p>"},{"location":"dronuts/#end-game","title":"End game?","text":"<p>You envision a number of ways this idea might make you fantastically wealthy.

The skills required to effectively prototype, launch, and scale products are vital to engineers everywhere, from fledgling companies founded in dorm rooms to local mid-size companies to internal startups from multi-national tech giants. However, developing software in a startup environment poses unique engineering challenges. These challenges include making and justifying foundational architectural and technical decisions despite extreme uncertainty; rapidly prototyping and evaluating new ideas and features, while building minimum viable products; prioritizing engineering effort in severely constrained environments; and communicating effectively both within a small engineering team and with internal and external non-technical stakeholders. This course teaches the skills necessary to engineer successfully in a startup environment, through lectures, group projects, case study discussions, and guest speakers drawn from experienced, practicing startup engineers.</p>"},{"location":"overview/#course-overview","title":"Course Overview","text":"<p>In this course, we will teach you the engineering skills necessary to succeed in the highly-uncertain environment associated with a technology startup.

Group work can be   hard, and not all teams succeed, and in fact a major contributing factor to   startup failure is team breakdown. The educational context adds its own   complexities: team members sometimes cannot prepare for or attend group   sessions because of other responsibilities, and conflicts can result from   personalities, differing skill levels, work ethics, working styles.</p> <p>We encourage the following practices to ensure successful group work:</p> <ul> <li>Agree on a protocol for meeting and communication.  Some, but not all, of   these decisions will be technical (e.g., should we use Slack or Trello?) that arise naturally over   startup development.</li> <li>In the startup context, engineers must be flexible and capable of filling   many technical roles.  In an educational context, however, group work is most   successful when groups designate clear roles, such as coordinator, scribe,   monitor, and checker for each assignment. Agree on roles at the beginning of   each assignment. Rotate these roles for each assignment to ensure   fairness.</li> <li>Agree on meeting times and what each member should have done before the   meeting (readings, development, writing, taking the first cut at some or all   of the assigned work, etc.). The scribe documents the agreed tasks and   deadlines and communicates them to everybody. Not objecting to the   communicated protocol constitutes acceptance. Make agreements visible to every   team member, with transparent history of the log.</li> <li>The coordinator checks with other team members before the meeting to   remind them of when and where they will meet and what they are supposed to   do. Team members notify the coordinator in advance if they cannot attend a   meeting or are in danger of not making a deadline.</li> <li>All individuals perform the required individual preparation before the   meeting.</li> <li>During meetings/work times, the coordinator sets  the agenda, and   keeps everyone on task; the monitor ensures everyone understands both   the solution and the strategy used to get it, and watches the time to ensure   meetings stays within the agreed timeslot; and the checker double-checks the   result before it is handed in, and submits it (or clearly delegates its   submission, if the checker is unable to do so on time).</li> <li>At the end of each meeting, agree on the next meeting time and responsibilities.</li> <li>Review returned assignments together.

Miscommunication or the general lack of communication are often the most common causes of team conflict.</p> <p>!!! Note: \"Team Conflict Example\"</p> <p>A common conflict in working style is when there are team members who always want to get a headstart on their work, while there are team members who are fine with doing work a few days before the deadline.

What modality would it be?</p> <p>A strong recommendation would be to set up a recurring 1-hour meeting blocked out for the rest of the semester so that your team does not have to scramble to find a common meeting time each week.

There are many different ways of developing such a model; ranging from building object-oriented class structures to to generating database schemas (like in SQL), or even as a formal UML diagram. Creating a a data model is crucial any time different components of an application are to interact. Examples include a database and server-side application or an MVC (Model, View, Controller) frontend and a server-side application.</p> <p>In this assignment, you will focus on defining a data model, represented in code with either an Object Document Mapper, ODM (for document-oriented NoSQL databases like MongoDB), or an Object Relational Mapper, ORM (for SQL databases like PostgresSQL). In pure Javascript, objects can be represented in a format called JSON.</p> <p>For instance, a <code>User</code> might be represented as follows:</p> <pre><code>{\n   \"username\" : \"ricksanchez\",\n   \"password\" : \"735ed12abec12bdcb42b\",\n   \"full_name\" : \"Rick Sanchez\",\n   \"followers\" : [\n      \"msmith\",\n      \"bperson\",\n      \"kmichael\",\n      \"mpbh\"\n   ]\n}\n</code></pre> <p>While this is a good example of a user, it is not entirely explanatory of the datatypes and relationships expressed in the data. Likewise, we might write out a document that looks something like this to help guide development:</p> <pre><code>{\n   \"username\" : String,    // UNIQUE, URL-SAFE\n   \"password\" : String,    // Salted, Hashed Password.\n   \"full_name\" : String,\n   \"twitter_id\" : ?String, // Optional, hence the question mark\n   \"followers\" : [String]  // Reference to other USER objects\n}\n</code></pre> <p>Much like developing in an object-oriented fashion within a single language, developing an object data model like this allows team members to coordinate development even across multiple projects (say, frontend and backend).  As such, your team should:</p> <ul> <li>As a group, decide on a list of relevant objects (Drones, Users, etc).</li> <li>For each of these objects, create an example object (like the first <code>User</code>   example above). Note that you may need to have multiple example objects if an   object can be in more than one state.</li> <li>For each of these objects, create a generalized, corresponding   data mapping (as shown above), mapping object fields to types, while   acknowleding if fields are optional, nullable, required, etc.   Comment as necessary to explain these constraints to us.</li> <li>Put all of the above examples and objects into your repository   Wiki.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"assignments/HW3/#database-choice","title":"Database Choice","text":"<p>Express.JS does not expose built-in functionality for defining data models.

However, this isn\u2019t always going to be the case; developers can make mistakes, API users can mis-use your API, and hackers can attempt to abuse your object model for nefarious purposes.</p> <p>To combat this, your application should programmatically validate objects, as defined by your data model. The way your team should implement this depends on your choice of database (MongDB vs PostgresSQL) and corresponding library: Mongoose (for MongoDB) or Sequelize (for PostgresSQL).</p> <p>For example, in Sequelize, a <code>User</code> model with constraints may be defined like this:</p> <pre><code>const { Sequelize, Op, Model, DataTypes } = require(\"sequelize\");\nconst sequelize = new Sequelize('postgres://user:pass@example.com:5432/dbname')\n\nconst User = sequelize.define(\"user\", {\n  username: {\n    type: DataTypes.TEXT,\n    allowNull: false,\n    unique: true\n  },\n  password: {\n    type: DataTypes.STRING(64),\n    validate: {\n      is: /^[0-9a-f]{64}$/i\n    }\n  }\n});\n\n(async () =&gt; {\n  await sequelize.sync({ force: true });\n  // Code here\n})();\n</code></pre> <p>where validations are automatically run on create, update and save. You can also call a <code>validate()</code> method to manually validate an instance.</p> <p>In Mongoose, upon defining your Schema object, you may get validation errors on save or by calling <code>validateSync</code>:</p> <pre><code>const schema = new Schema({\n  username: {\n    type: String,\n    required: true\n  }\n  phone: {\n    type: String,\n    validate: {\n      validator: function(v) {\n        return /\\d{3}-\\d{3}-\\d{4}/.test(v);\n      },\n      message: props =&gt; `${props.value} is not a valid phone number!`\n    },\n    required: [true, 'User phone number required']\n  }\n});\n\nconst User = db.model('user', schema);\nuser.phone = '201-555-0123';\n\n// This person has no username :(\nconst user = new User();\n\nlet error;\ntry {\n  await user.save();\n} catch (err) {\n  error = err;\n}\n\nassert.equal(error.errors['username'].message,\n  'Path `username` is required.');\n\nerror = user.validateSync();\nassert.equal(error.errors['username'].message,\n  'Path `name` is required.');\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"assignments/HW3/#paper-prototype","title":"Paper Prototype","text":"<p>To help you synthesize all your team\u2019s ideas into a single design, you will start by developing a series of paper prototypes.

We'll be focusing on React in recitations however.</p> <p>Your team can familiarize themselves with React using the following resources:</p> <ul> <li>Intro to React Tutorial</li> <li>React Tutorial</li> <li>React Fundamentals</li> </ul> <p>Using a frotend framework like React (which is MV*'ish, but not explicitly MVC), your team should develop a prototype:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Develop a view-only prototype for the 1-3 largest user stories in your   project. What you do not accomplish in this sprint, you will need to accomplish   later, so budget your time appropriately.  This should be a prototype, so   while it should demonstrate how a user will interact with the system, it does   not need to be \"pixel perfect.\" Because it is view only, you should be able to   navigate across pages, but you do not need to implement any part of the backend   (data processing, validation, generation) at this point.</p> </li> <li> <p>Your team will be deploying your application hosted on the cloud. Again,   we recommend Render for deployment. Please ensure   that your submission deploys correctly upon submission of your assignment.</p> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"assignments/HW3/#use-of-typescript","title":"Use of Typescript","text":"<p>In this class, we highly recommend the use of Typescript instead of Javascript for your Dronuts prototype.

Miscommunication or the general lack of communication are the most common causes of team conflict. </p> <p>Team Conflict Example</p> <p>A common conflict in working style is when there are team members who always want to get a headstart on their work, while there are team members who are fine with doing work a few days before the deadline. It causes panic in the former team members, while the latter team members feel frustrated as to why they are being rushed. </p> <p>As such, your first process task of the semester will be creating a teamwork contract with your teammates.

Punctuality?  How would your team accommodate when unexpected commitments come up for a team member (e.g. interviews, sickness, competitions)? Do account for the fact that project load can get heavier towards the end of the semester. </p> </li> <li> <p>Communication What platform(s) will your team be using to communicate? What is the expected time to get a response?  For any communication platforms you decide on, please test that everyone can receive notifications.

A strong recommendation would be to set up a recurring 1 hour meeting blocked out for the rest of the semester, so that your team does not have to scramble to find a common meeting time each week.  Teams that have recurring meetings are generally more successful in the class.</p> </li> <li> <p>Responsibilities How will you divide responsibilities for each part of the project? During meetings,  who will be in charge of note taking, organizing &amp; running those meetings?  Often, a natural project manager will emerge, who will ensure the project moves towards completion.  Throughout the semester, we will ask for documentation of your meeting notes,  so be sure to keep them organized (we recommend using a shared Drive folder).</p> </li> <li> <p>Equitable Contribution &amp; Conflict Resolution What are the steps the team would take to address teammates who are contributing too little,  and when will the team bring this up to the instructors?  What are the steps to bring up and discuss potential teamwork issues? The first thing the staff will ask the student when they mention that they are facing team issues  is if they have followed the steps on their team contract. How will you continue to work in the case of an irresolvable conflict between team members?  We recognize that intra-team conflict occurs, but we also need to see results.

Your mission in this class is to create a technology startup company whose goal is to make Pittsburgh a better place to live. However, your startup isn't here to make Pittsburgh a better place for you \u2014 we want your technology startup to make Pittsburgh a better place for other Pittsburghers.</p> <p>The first step is to choose a community of Pittsburgh residents whose problems you feel you are uniquely suited to solve. That's probably a difficult question to answer right now. </p> <p>Instead, think about the parts of the city you are familiar with. This could be the street that you live on, the transit option you take to get to school, the restaurants you frequent or grocery stores you shop at, the museums and entertainment establishments you visit, the parks you exercise in, or the roads you drive on. </p> <p>Think about the communities in the city you've gotten to know. This could be your adult friends who live in Pittsburgh, the people who ride the same bus as you, the neighbors who help you shovel your sidewalk, the people who attend the same social clubs or affinity groups, friends from your youth who also moved to Pittsburgh, the residents of the senior citizen center or homeless shelter you volunteer at, the doctors and nurses who work at the hospital you've had the unfortunate need to meet, or the workers who pick up your trash and recycling every week. </p> <p>What problems do you think people in these parts of the city or in these communities have experienced? Which of those problems do you think you have the background or interest to solve? </p> <ul> <li>Write a paragraph or two about the areas and communities that interest you and some problems that may be worth solving. </li> </ul> <p>Warning</p> <p>Your community must have a real connection to Pittsburgh that distinguishes them from a community that lives somewhere else. You may not choose any community that operates within the CMU campus or any student community from any university in Pittsburgh. We want you to think how you can help Pittsburgh's other communities. Avoid communities that are student-adjacent, for example restaurants that primarily serve Pitt or CMU students on Forbes Ave. or Craig St, or really, any Pittsburgh-based business whose clientele are primarily college students. </p> <p>Your team may use the community chosen by one of your team members in HW1a. However, the community must conform to the additional constraints above. </p> <p>You must run your community idea past your TA for approval before going on to Question 2.
