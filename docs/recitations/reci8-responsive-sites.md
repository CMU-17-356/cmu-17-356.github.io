# Example
[Example Link](https://www.w3schools.com/css/tryit.asp?filename=tryresponsive_w3css)
As you can see, resizing the window does not negatively affect the user experience on the website. You can also try this by resizing the window of your browser and observing if the website components resize!

# Accessibility
- Website is designed and developed in a way that allows all users, including those with disabilities, to perceive, understand, navigate, and interact with the content effectively
- Accessibility involves removing barriers that might prevent people with disabilities from accessing information or using features on a website
- The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) are web accessibility guidelines published by the Web Accessibility Initiative of the World Wide Web Consortium (the main international standards organization for the Internet), which sets a standard of how websites should be accessible
