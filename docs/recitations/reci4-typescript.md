## What and Why Typescript?
- TypeScript is a strongly typed, object-oriented, compiled programming language that builds on JavaScript
- Provides an easy way to structure your objects and enforce type validation on them
- Provides great tooling in your IDEs which help catch bugs that potentially would have otherwise been caught in deployment
- 0 learning curve if you already know JS


## Install Typescript
- To install TS globally:
    - npm i -g typescript
    - tsc --version
- To create a react-typescript project:
  - npx create-react-app .  â†’ plain react app
  - npx create-react-app <project-name> --template typescript

## tsconfig.json
- The presence of a tsconfig.json file in a directory indicates that the directory is the root of a TypeScript project.
- The tsconfig.json file specifies the root files and the compiler options required to compile the project.

## How to make your variables strongly typed

- Not specifying a type/using the type "any" - NOT A GREAT PRACTICE!

## Creating custom types

## Strong typing a function

## Strong typing arrays/lists

## Generics

## Experiment with TS
- Create a react typescript app
- Check the contents in the project
- Run the app
- Create new components
- Add props with types
