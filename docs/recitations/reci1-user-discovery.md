# Recitation 1 - User Discovery

### Step 1: Choose a Focus/Idea
- What problems are you suited to solve?

### Step 2: Design a Set of Questions
- Their life story **>>>** Your idea
- Past **>>>** Future

### Step 3: Ask People Questions
- Find **4 people** in your target demographic, talk to them:
  - Friends
  - Strangers on the street
  - LinkedIn
- **Don’t** use people in the class for homework.
- **GPT is not a person.**

---

## Exercise: Choose a Focus (5 minutes)
- **What problem do you want to solve?**
  Could be a pain point for you or someone you know.

---

## Exercise: Write Down a Set of Questions (5 minutes)
- Collect as much **concrete, relevant information** about pain points as possible.
- If the other person is clearly not a member of your target demographic:
  - Try to collect insights anyway (though at a certain point, you may have to give up).

### Avoid:
- Asking unhelpful questions:
  - Too much assumption.
  - Questions that lead to biased answers.
  - Wrong target audience.
- Design questions to gather information **efficiently.**

---

## Exercise: Ask People Questions (10 minutes)
- Practice with classmates (2 people per group).
- Allow space for **general conversation**, since the idea is early-stage.

---

## Retrospective
- **What you learned** from these discovery conversations:
  - What problems did they have?
  - How did they solve them?
  - What wasn’t a problem?
- **What does this mean** to your:
  - Product
  - Focus area
  - Problem of choice
