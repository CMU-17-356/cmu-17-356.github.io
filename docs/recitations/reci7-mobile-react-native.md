# React Native
- Framework developed by Facebook
- Allows building mobile applications using JavaScript and React

## Benefits 
- Cross-Platform Compatibility - Develop for iOS and Android with a single codebase
- Native Look and Feel - Utilizes native components for a seamless user experience
- Fast Development - Write code once, deploy everywhere, reducing development time
- Community Support - Large community and ecosystem for resources and assistance

## Usage of React Native
- Developers write code in JavaScript and React Native translates this code into native components, which are rendered for a mobile UI
- React Native is used to:
   - Develop mobile applications
   - Quickly build prototypes
   - Develop MVPâ€™s to validate concepts and gather user feedback
