For example, 
---
- ###As a **delivery driver** I would like to be able to have **multiple destinations** so that I can **maximize tips by doing multiple deliveries as fast as possible**

## Food for Thought
- What are the benefits of **INVEST**?
- What are the issues with the **INVEST** approach? 

## Let's try it out
- Capture a description of a software feature from an end-user perspective
- (As a class) Letâ€™s come up with a small example application
- Same teams, Brainstorm and write 5-10 user stories

## The 3C's Approach
- **Card:** The user stories written on cards by customer/product owner
- **Conversation:** The communication between customer/product owner and developers
- **Confirmation:** Acceptance criteria/test

## Brass Tacks
- **Homework 1** available on the course website now
