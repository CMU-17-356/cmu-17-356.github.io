## Working effectively

Working effectively in a group is a critical skill in modern software
  engineering, both in the startup context and generally.  Group work can be
  hard, and not all teams succeed, and in fact a major contributing factor to
  startup failure is team breakdown. The educational context adds its own
  complexities: team members sometimes cannot prepare for or attend group
  sessions because of other responsibilities, and conflicts can result from
  personalities, differing skill levels, work ethics, working styles.

We encourage the following practices to ensure successful group work:

- Agree on a protocol for meeting and communication.  Some, but not all, of
  these decisions will be technical (Slack? Trello?) that arise naturally over
  startup development.
- In the startup context, engineers must be flexible and capable of filling
  many technical roles.  In an educational context, however, group work is most
  successful when groups designate clear roles, such as coordinator, scribe,
  monitor, and checker for each assignment. Agree on roles at the beginning of
  each assignment. Rotate these roles for each assignment to ensure
  fairness.
- Agree on meeting times and what each member should have done before the
  meeting (readings, development, writing, taking the first cut at some or all
  of the assigned work, etc.). The **scribe** documents the agreed tasks and
  deadlines and communicates them to everybody. Not objecting to the
  communicated protocol constitutes acceptance. Make agreements visible to every
  team member, with transparent history of the log.
- The **coordinator** checks with other team members before the meeting to
  remind them of when and where they will meet and what they are supposed to
  do. Team members notify the coordinator in advance if they cannot attend a
  meeting or are in danger of not making a deadline.
- All individuals perform the required individual preparation before the
  meeting.
- During meetings/work times, the **coordinator** sets  the agenda, and
  keeps everyone on task; the **monitor** ensures everyone understands both
  the solution and the strategy used to get it, and watches the time to ensure
  meetings stays within the agreed timeslot; and the **checker** double-checks the
  result before it is handed in, and submits it (or clearly delegates its
  submission, if the checker is unable to do so on time).
- At the end of each meeting, agree on the next meeting time and responsibilities.
- Review returned assignments together. Make sure everyone understands why
  points were lost and how to correct errors.

## Preventing and dealing with problems ##

We encourage you to communicate openly with your teammates, which is often enough to help resolve many types
  of team challenges. Clearly documenting agreed-upon tasks and deadlines (see
  scribe role above) and tracking invested time helps in identifying
  issues. Renegotiate agreements when estimated time does not align with
  actually required time and imbalances arise. Document where agreements were
  not honored (what and when, and possibly why). Identify a fallback strategy,
  ideally in agreement with the team member who failed the agreement. In severe
  cases, identify how other team members can take over those tasks.

If a team member does not contribute to an assignment solution, their name
  should not be included on the completed work.

If the problem persists and cannot be solved within the team, the team should
  meet with the instructors so that the problem can be resolved, if possible. If
  problems continue, the cooperating team members may notify the uncooperative
  member in writing that he/she is in danger of being fired, sending a copy of
  the memo to the instructor. If there is no subsequent improvement, they should
  notify the individual in writing (copy to the instructor) that he/she is no
  longer with the team. The fired student should meet with the instructors to
  discuss options, such as finding another team willing to add them as a member,
  completing the work alone, or getting zeroes for the remaining
  assignments.

Consult with your instructors if a conflict arises that can't be worked
  through by the team.
