## Course Description

Startup engineering is critical to innovation. The skills required
            to effectively prototype, launch, and scale products are vital to
            engineers everywhere, from fledgling companies founded in dorm rooms
            to local mid-size companies to internal startups from multi-national
            tech giants. However, developing software in a startup environment
            poses unique engineering challenges. These challenges include making
            and justifying foundational architectural and technical decisions
            despite extreme uncertainty; rapidly prototyping and evaluating new
            ideas and features, while building minimum viable products;
            prioritizing engineering effort in severely constrained
            environments; and communicating effectively both within a small
            engineering team and with internal and external non-technical
            stakeholders. This course teaches the skills necessary to engineer
            successfully in a startup environment, through lectures, group
            projects, case study discussions, and guest speakers drawn from
            experienced, practicing startup engineers.

## Course Overview

In this course, we will teach you the engineering skills necessary to succeed in the highly-uncertain environment associated with a technology startup.  Our focus in this class is technical; that is, we will not be spending very much time on the business side of the startup equation (though given how much business drives engineering goals, of course we will not completely ignore it!). If you are instead interested in the entrepreneurship side of the equation, we encourage you to consider 15-390, Entrepreneurship for Computer Scientists.

This class will consist of:

- **Lectures.** Lectures will cover technical content, and be delivered by the
  professors or other instructors. 
- **Guest lectures and panels.** We will hear from from practicing software
  engineers, technical and non-technical startup cofounders, and other
  individuals with practical expertise. 
- **Recitation.** TAs will lead recitation, which consists of activities designed to help you apply your knowledge practically and prepare for the
  homework.
- **Homework assignments.** For the first half of the course, you will practice
  the skills we learn in class by working on in assigned teams on a made-up
  startup, "Dronuts." Most of this work will be structured as a series of
  agile-style sprints, to simulate as much as possible the real startup
  experience.
- **A project.** For the second half of the course, you will use your new skills
  to design and implement an original startup idea.  Donâ€™t worry if you don't
  have one; we'll help you to develop a new idea, or connect founders who have
  startup ideas to co-founders who are excited to help with them.

There will be one midterm exam.  There will be no final exam; instead, you will present your final project.
