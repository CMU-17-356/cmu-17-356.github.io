## Learning Goals

- Learn how to get an LLM to create sound user stories that accurately reflect your planning goals.
- Identify key user stories that will constitute a Minimum Viable Product (MVP).
- Justify which features to include based on priority, and time available.

## 1. User Stories

You will create user stories that correspond to the primary use cases of a web-based 4-function calculator. You may use an LLM to write the user stories for you.

  1. Create 6 user stories for a web-based 4-function calculator. Make sure it uses the proper template:
    - As a <user\>, I want <action\> so that <benefit\>. Then add your machine and human acceptance criteria afterwards.
    - Add a one paragraph explanation of why each user story is important to the overall user experience of the application.
    - For each user story, identify ambiguous behaviors that must be resolved and describe how to handle them. For example, what should happen if the user hits the + button twice in a row? What if the user hits the * button twice in a row?
    - Estimate each user story's size as a t-shirt (Small, Medium, Large, Xtra-Large). 
      Be sure to consider not just how long the user story will take to implement, but also how long it will take a computer and how long it will take a human to verify that it was implemented correctly and as you intended (no more, no less!)
  2. Evaluate the user stories according to the [INVEST](https://xp123.com/invest-in-good-stories-and-smart-tasks/) framework we learned in class. You may use an LLM to help you with this analysis.
    - At least one of these user stories should be dependent on another.
    - Throw out 3 user stories that you feel aren't necessary for a 4-function calculator MVP. 
  3. Prioritize the remaining 3 user stories into a list. Why did you pick this order? 
  4. If you consulted an LLM for any part of this assignment, you must turn in the LLM chat logs. Hint: ChatGPT chat logs can be referenced by a simple URL.
