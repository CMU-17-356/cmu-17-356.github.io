This homework is to be done individually.

## Learning Goals

- Learn how to get an LLM to create sound user stories that accurately reflect your planning goals
- Identify key user stories that will constitute a Minimum Viable Product (MVP).
- Justify which features to include based on priority, and time available

## 1. User Stories

You will create user stories that correspond to the primary use cases of a web-based 4-function calculator. You may use an LLM to write the user stories for you.

  1. Create 6 user stories for a web-based 4-function calculator. Make sure it uses the proper template:
    - As a <user\>, I want <action\> so that <benefit\>. 
    - Add an explanation of what each user story is really about.
    - For each user story, identify ambiguous behaviors that must be resolved and describe how to handle them. For example, what should happen if the user hits the + button twice in a row? What if the user hits the * button twice in a row?
    - Estimate each user story's size as a t-shirt (Small, Medium, Large, Xtra-Large). 
      Be sure to consider not just how long the user story will take to implement, but also how long it will take
      you to verify that it was implemented correctly and as you intended (no more, no less)
  2. Evaluate the user stories according to the [INVEST](https://xp123.com/invest-in-good-stories-and-smart-tasks/) framework we learned in class. You may use an LLM to help you with this analysis.
    - At least one of these user stories should be dependent on another.
    - Throw out 3 user stories that you feel aren't necessary for a 4-function calculator MVP. 
  3. Prioritize the remaining 3 user stories into a list. Why did you pick this order?
