This final project homework is to be done and submitted as a team.<br/>
</p>

## Learning Goals

Congratulations! Your project has found an investor who expects you to show them an MVP by the end of the semester. You should use the knowledge and experience you gained during the semester to build the MVP and satisfy that investor. We will not set deadlines for you this time. Instead, you must create your own plan. We will monitor your progress. It is your job to manage your time and your team to reach your goals in time.

## Homework Tasks

In this pre-project sprint, you should specify user stories that will be included in your MVP and a plan/timeline to achieve them. This plan should include how many sprints you plan to do, and what you plan to achieve during those sprints, and when they should take place. You must also decide upon your tech stack: front-end and backend frameworks, databases, CI, team communication tools, etc.

You will also create a project home page that displays your project name, list of team members, project logo, pitch deck content (not just a pointer to your slides), and two-sentence elevator pitch for what it's all about. This page should be hosted in your GitHub wiki. 

We continue to expect you to make proper use of your Kanban board, especially when assigning tasks to (all) team members. 

## Team Deliverables 

A project proposal document containing the following:

- A short intro/motivation for your startup and product (1-2 paragraphs)
- Project home page URL. 
- Set of prioritized user stories that will be included in your MVP. (Recall HW2).
    - You should have a project backlog in some online tool that your team members can use to collaborate with; e.g., GitHub Projects, GitHub Issues, Trello, Zenhub, etc. Include a printout in PDF format of this backlog with your proposal.
- A list of user interfaces your product should contain, along with wireframes for each (Recall HW3).
- A list of what you will use in your tech stack: backend framework, front-end framework, database, GitHub repository, etc. Agree upon and list your communication tools (e.g., Slack, etc), and development infrastructure (development environment, CI, code style/linting). Agree upon and list where you will deploy your application (e.g., fly.io, Azure, Heroku, AWS, etc).
- Plan/timeline you anticipate following to build the MVP.
    - How many sprints will you do? What will you accomplish during each sprint? When will each sprint take place? (Schedule them on a calendar.)
    - In this plan, you should include how you plan to divide the workload among team members. **Keep in mind that we will evaluate you against your own timeline, so try to be realistic.**

**Note: To evaluate your progress for the rest of this project, we will be scheduling regular meetings with your team for the remainder of the semester. Keep this in mind and take care to plan a realistic schedule.**
