# Homework 5: Sprint 3 (Final Dronuts Sprint)


<p style="text-align: center;">
100 points<br/>

Due on Gradescope Wednesday, March 20, 2023 11:59pm<br/>

This homework is to be done and submitted as a team.<br/>

A portion of this assignment will be graded for you individually and the other
portion will be graded for your team as a whole.<br/>
</p>

## Learning Goals

In this homework, you will conduct your third (and final) sprint with your team
to complete a presentable Minimum Viable Product (MVP) for the Dronuts
Application. In completing this assignment, you will develop the skills needed
to:

- Use appropriate technology to build and finalize your MVP.
- Select and measure appropriate indicators that will help you evaluate
  viability.
- Be ready to present your software to stakeholders.

## Homework Tasks

In this sprint, you should improve your MVP along the following lines:

- You should ensure that your customer facing side and your store facing sides
are communicating. (e.g., this means that a customer should be able to create an
order that shows up for the store, and the store should be able to make some
change that the client sees, like maybe adding a donut type, or changing a
price).
- You should now be able to do some end-to-end testing. You are expected to have
at least one end-to-end (integration) test for the customer facing side, and one
end-to-end (integration) test for the store facing side.
- You should incorporate the [DroneTech](https://cmu-17-356.github.io/project/drone_api/)
and [CommerceFriend](https://cmu-17-356.github.io/project/credit_api/) into your
application to some varying degree (if you haven't already).
- **Optionally, you may choose to implement a map to show where the drones are,
and how they are moving to deliveries. If you choose to implement this, you will
receive 10 extra credit points.**

Proper use of your Kanban board should be maintained and tasks should be
assigned to team members.

## Demonstration of Individual Actions

All team members should still be making pull requests (PRs) when adding/pushing
new code. PRs should be used to close out their corresponding issues.

As you progress toward your MVP, **every individual team member** should
demonstrate

- At least one task on the Kanban board is assigned to them.
- A pull request merged with at least one *+1* from a reviewer.
- Adding at least one constructive comment on another team memberâ€™s Pull Request.

We will visit your GitHub repo to check that these have occurred with timestamps
prior to the assignment deadline of March 20th. If GitHub fails to show any
evidence of your work, you will lose points from the individual portion of your
grade.

## Final Team Deliverables (85 points)

- **Release version 1.0 of your code.**

You have the option of choosing your delivery date for this homework.  To let us
know your choice, you should [tag a release version](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/releasing-projects-on-github/managing-releases-in-a-repository)
of your code in your Github repo.  The timestamp of the release that you create
will be your delivery date from the perspective of the staff. Regardless, please
tag a version as 1.0 before 11:59pm March 20th, with or without the optional
drone map.

Submit the URL to your release to [Gradescope](https://www.gradescope.com/courses/704199/assignments/4163741).

## Individual Deliverable (15 points)

As this is your final sprint for the Dronuts application, you should write a 1-2
page reflection on your experiences. Some of the points that you should reflect
upon include the following:

- The project, itself:
    - How did your project turn out?
    - Did your team complete everything you expected? Why or why not?
    - Are you satisfied with its functionality? Why?
    - Are you satisfied with its quality? Why?
- Your individual performance:
    - What new skills did you learn?
    - What do you wish you had done differently?
    - What would you have done the same?
- Your team's performance:
    - What went well?
    - What went poorly?
    - What will you do differently with your next team?

Additionally, you are required to summarize your contributions to the Dronuts
project, and your perception of the contributions of your teammates.
