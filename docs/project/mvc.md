# MVC

## Introduction
MVC stands for Model, View, Controller. It is a pattern for
developing software applications.  We will explain more about this
in recitation, though there are an abundance of tutorials online.

## Choosing a MVC Framework
There are many [MVC Frameworks](http://todomvc.com/) to choose from.  While you may choose any framework you wish, we strongly
encourage you to use one of the following:

* <b>Angular 5</b> <br>
  Developed predominately by Google, Angular
  is a highly powerful MVC framework.  While
  it has a steep learning curve, it also has
  direct bindings for Loopback.

* <b>React</b> <br>
  Developed predominately by Facebook, React is
  a lighter-weight MVC framework. It is fairly easy
  to learn.

* <b>Vue.js</b> <br>
  Vue.js is another player on the block. It is easy to
  learn, but there is a realtively small user base.

* <b>Svelte</b> <br>
