# Project 2: Implementation Milestone 1

## Learning Goals

- Practice and refine your Agile engineering approach
- Use what you've learned in the homeworks to build and plan to deploy an app
- Get feedback from users on an MVP

## Project Context

You and your team will be spending the rest of the semester building
a product prototype for your startup. This is the first technical
towards your whole product MVP; at the end of this assignment, you
will produce a minimal product that users can interact with.

## Deliverables

### 1. Repository setup

Over the course of the past homeworks, you've learned about automating
your development setup: branch protection, CI, formatters, linters,
PR templates, conventional commits, and more. It's time to create
the development setup that works best for your specific project!
At *bare minimum*, this setup should include:

- The requirement to review PRs before merging to main
- CI testing of some kind
- High level code review guidelines
- A lower-level code review checklist 

We expect to see something beyond the bare minimum. 

#### Turn in instructions

Please turn in:

- A link to your repository (and invite the instructors to
collaborate as admins).
- A bulleted list of all the rules, actions, workflows, and checklists
you've set up, with a link to your repo and a justification for each
one.

### 2. Deployment overview

To actually ship your app, you'll need to deploy it somewhere.
*You do not need to deploy the whole thing right away*, though you
can choose to do so if you'd like. At minimum, for this step
we need a detailed description of your deployment approach.

You have access to an AWS account (the account from HW5) and
AWS credits if you choose to use them. 

#### Turn in instructions

Please turn in a deployment plan for your application similar in
detail to HW5. It should outline each step of your proposed
deployment pipeline, and each step should link to the relevant
documentation.

### 3. Sprint 1 (two weeks)

In P0, you planned your initial sprint. Now it's time to
implement! You will:

- Take into account any feedback on your Sprint 1 plan from P0 and
adjust as necessary.
- Hold a sprint planning meeting: assign tasks to members of your
group and give those tasks deadlines.
- Organize a daily standup. This should be *very fast* and can be
remote if you prefer.
- Implement PRs for each ticket and review and merge those PRs.
- Hold a sprint retrospective.

#### Turn in instructions

You will turn in:
- A link to your GitHub project tracker, which should clearly show
tickets, who they are assigned to, and when the corresponding PRs
were merged.
- A description of your sprint retrospective. What worked well
this sprint? What will you change for next sprint?
- A description of how to how to use your app and try out the
features you've implemented; for example, you might describe
how to build a website locally and then how to interact with
that website to test out five different features. *The instructors
will follow these instructions when grading, so make sure they work.* 

### 5. User feedback

TODO: Andy, what do you think here?
