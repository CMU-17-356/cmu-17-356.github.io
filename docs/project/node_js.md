# Node.JS

## Introduction
NodeJS is a runtime for Javascript-based server applications, which has gained
popularity in recent years because of its flexibility and ability to handle
many concurrent connections. We ask that you write your server-side application
in NodeJS, as you will need to write your frontend in Javascript anyway; meaning
you (at worst) have to familiarize yourself with a single new language.

While we will cover some of the fundamentals of NodeJS in recitation, you may
need to spend additional time on some of the basics if you are not yet familiar
with Node.  Here are some resources to help you become familiar with Node:

* <b>[learnyounode](https://github.com/workshopper/learnyounode#learn-you-the-nodejs-for-much-win)</b><br>
  A CLI-based walkthrough of the basic patterns of NodeJS.

* <b>[Promises for Dummies](https://scotch.io/tutorials/javascript-promises-for-dummies)</b><br>
  Promises are a programming pattern for simplifying asynchronous code.

* <b>[RxJS Tutorial](http://reactivex.io/rxjs/manual/tutorial.html)</b><br>
  RxJS provides a set of library for reactive programming.

## Setup
