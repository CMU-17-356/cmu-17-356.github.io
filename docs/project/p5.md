# Project 5: Final Project Presentation

## Learning Goals

- Learn to pitch your project to investors and users

## Project Context

You have finished your prototype, honed your technology, and polished your demo. 
Your startup is ready to launch!  You have some initial evidence 
about how your users are responding to your app. You are confident that your 
business plan will succeed and make you wealthy beyond your wildest dreams.

You have entered a startup competition to see who can hook a shark --- an investor 
with deep pockets --- who will fund your startup and get you to the next level.

## Deliverable

### Final Project Presentation (15 minutes)

- Presentations are **15 minutes long, with 5 minutes Q&A**.
- The order of presentations is randomly determined.
- Participation from all team members during the presentation is **required**. Absent team members will lose points individually.
- Every classmate will be given $1,000 (fake money) to fund your favorite startups in the class (other than your own). You will also offer constructive feedback for other startup presentations in class via a paper form (which we will provide day-of).

In this presentation, you will show your investors (the class!) a walkthrough of your end-to-end MVP along with your business plan. You do not need to include details related to the backend. Your investors are mostly interested in seeing the progress and functionality of your product and how you plan to make money. Your presentation must **include a demo of your top user stories**. You may use slides but are not required to. 

**All team members must participate.**
**Each team member must speak for at least 3 minutes of time (total over the whole presentation)**.

The following presentation elements are required (but may be combined as appropriate), not necessarily in this order:

- Introduce your team name, team members, and each member's roles as they actually ended up playing them throughout the semester.
- Introduce the main concept of your MVP.
- Introduce the business plan. Show us how you convinced yourselves this plan was viable. 
- Demo your MVP (in a walkthrough organized by _user stories_, not by features).
- Describe any external feedback (from outside your team) that you received on your MVP.
- What metrics are you collecting and monitoring that help you evaluate your business plan? 
- Imagine your product is wildly successful and gains millions of users in a very short period of time. 
    1. What is the first technical part of the implementation that will break and how could you fix it?
    1. What is the first part of your business plan that will need to be modified? 
- Each individual team member must explain the most important lesson they personally learned throughout the process of developing the team's MVP and business plan.
- Somewhere in the presentation, you must name drop someone famous or important in the same technical field as your application concept. The person you name drop must be alive. Make it sound like this person is your long-time friend.
