# UI Development

## Introduction

MVC stands for Model, View, Controller. It is a pattern for
developing software applications.  We will explain more about this
in recitation, though there are an abundance of tutorials online.

## Choosing a UI library/framework

There are many [MV* Frameworks](http://todomvc.com/) and UI development
libraries to choose from. Not all of them are truly MVC (like React for
instance), but many are fully featured. While you may choose any framework you
wish, we strongly encourage you to use one of the following:

* <b>Angular 5</b> <br>
  Developed predominately by Google, Angular
  is a highly powerful MVC framework. While
  it has a steep learning curve, it also has
  direct bindings for Loopback.

* <b>React</b> <br>
  Developed predominately by Facebook/Meta, React is
  a lighter-weight framework. It is fairly easy
  to learn and extremely popular.

* <b>Vue.js</b> <br>
  Vue.js is another popular choice. It's performant and
  easy to learn, but there are fewer resources available
  compared to React.

* <b>Svelte</b> <br>
  Svelte has become a popular framework as of late,
  as it's focused on coverting your app into performant
  Javascript at build time (i.e. compile time), rather
  than interpreting your code at run time.
