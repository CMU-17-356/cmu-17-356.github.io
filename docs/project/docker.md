### Dockerizing your Application
You should create a Docker file, which encapsulates your application.
You can read more about Dockerizing a NodeJS application in
[the NodeJS Documentation](https://nodejs.org/en/docs/guides/nodejs-docker-webapp/).

### Docker Compose

[Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) is a tool for defining and
running multi-container Docker applications. With Docker Compose, you use a YAML
file to configure your applicationâ€™s services. Then, with a single command, you
create and start all the services from your configuration.
